                <p lang="en">
                    New York ended its three‐day involvement with the 70th World Series without riot or ruin last 
                    night as the Mets defeated the Oakland A's, 2‐0, and took the Series lead for the first time.

                    Koosman and Tug McGraw and for the glovemen behind them. And at the height of McGraw's latest 
                    adventure as an escape artist with the bases loaded, Mayor Lindsay stood in the front‐row box 
                    nearest the home dugout and held high a 5‐foot sign that ecboed the team's war cry: “Ya Gotta 
                    Believe.”

                    It was the sixth time in the last two weeks that the Mayor had watched the Mets do their 
                    thing in playoff and Series, and a strange thing it is. They went from last place to the 
                    pennant in six weeks, fell behind the defending champion A's twice in the Series and finally 
                    passed them last night, to move within one game of the championship. kjjnnk jnk jnkjn
